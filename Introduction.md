# Introduction #

The home-page of the project developed during the course of _Ingegneria dei sistemi software_.
This project aims to develop a first meta-model for mobile applications (in particular Android apps) focusing on the basic components and notions useful in a mobile environment.

In the particular context a first-level language, **AndroidL**, is created using **xText** and with the **xPand** tool the generators M2C are provided, which can be used to generate platform-dependent code (Android in this case) starting from an instance of the created language.
